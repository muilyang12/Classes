# Computer Graphics Class

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of various computer graphics algorithms and techniques, developed as part of my Computer Graphics coursework. The focus is on understanding the core principles behind modern rendering pipelines and graphics programming, including MVP (Model-View-Projection), rasterization, and other key concepts. The implementations use foundational library such as `Eigen` for matrix calculation.
