# Computer Graphics Class

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of various computer graphics algorithms, developed as part of my Computer Graphics coursework and assignments. The focus is on understanding the core principles behind modern rendering pipelines and graphics programming. The implementations use foundational library such as `Eigen` for matrix calculation.
