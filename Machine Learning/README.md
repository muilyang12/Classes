# Machine Learning Class

## Overview

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning algorithms, created from scratch as part of my Machine Learning coursework. The focus is on developing a deeper understanding of how these algorithms work at a fundamental level, without relying on high-level machine learning libraries like scikit-learn. Each algorithm has been implemented in Python, leveraging core libraries such as `numpy` for efficient mathematical operations.
